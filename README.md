# Text Summarization 
This repo covers the methods to generate summary for the text document
The notebook 101 shows the extractive summarization for the text. In this we collect the document and calculate score for the sentence. The score for the sentence can be calculated using sum of frequency of words of sentence in the document by deviding the total word count(counting does not include stop words)
The text preprocessing done in this notebook only stem and removing stop words.
